As she went to middle school, she went on her first audition by her friend's recommendation to challenge her dream. So, she became a trainee of YG Entertainment by 5 years but when her debut didn't happen, she left the company. Life outside the company was difficult for her since she spent all her childhood as a trainee. After this, she took some time to look back on herself. Then, she attended a vocal academy to strengthen her vocal skills and took classes about composing and producing music. There were invitations/chances for her to audition in other companies but felt scared and burdened for someone who already gave up being in a girl group. She thought there will no more opportunities for her but there was Cube. She then auditioned where she had a short time to prepare and felt nervous while auditioning. She passed the audition and worked really hard whilst being a trainee. She became happy because she could now sing and dance as she had in the past.
